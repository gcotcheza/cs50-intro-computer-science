# CS50 Introduction to Computer Science - Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises and problem sets from the [CS50 Introduction to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course by Harvard University, available on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science). The course is an entry-level introduction to computer science, covering algorithms, software development, and various programming languages. It's designed to develop both programming skills and understanding of computational thinking.

## About CS50

CS50, taught by Professor David J. Malan, is Harvard University's introductory course for majors and non-majors alike, a one-semester amalgam of courses generally taught separately in other departments. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. CS50 is not only a computer science course but also an opportunity to become a better thinker and problem solver.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized by weeks, corresponding to the CS50 course's schedule. Each directory contains solutions to the exercises and problem sets for that particular week. Here is an overview of the topics covered each week:

- **Week 0**: Scratch
- **Week 1**: C
- **Week 2**: Arrays
- **Week 3**: Algorithms
- **Week 4**: Memory
- **Week 5**: Data Structures
- **Week 6**: Python
- **Week 7**: SQL
- **Week 8**: Information
- **Week 9**: Final Project

Please note that these solutions are my personal attempts to solve the problems given in the course. They might not be perfect, but they represent my journey through the world of computer science.

## How to Use This Repository

You can browse through the folders to see my solutions for each week. If you're currently taking the CS50 course or planning to, feel free to compare solutions but try to solve the problems on your own first to get the most out of the course.

## Acknowledgments

All the course material, including the problem sets, is provided by [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and available through [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science). I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in getting started with computer science.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Professor David J. Malan and the CS50 staff for creating and providing such an invaluable resource for learning computer science.
